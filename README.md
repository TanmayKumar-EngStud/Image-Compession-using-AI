<h2>This project is Designed to Compress an Image as much as possible with the use of AI</h2>
<hr>
The Idea is to first decode image in text ASCII format <br>
compress that ASCII text using Huffman coding, Whenever that image is needed then it is first retrieved from that ASCII art and then with the use of AI <br>
That Image can be sharpened (Using the GANs technique) and we can get back out image. <Hr>
This can't be used on genera devices, it needs a bit powerful machiene so the best application of this kind of technique could be in Big Data Software Companies,<br>
<h3>Where is it useful ?</h3><br>
<p>For Example if someone is using WhatsApp and want's to delete lots of images, then those images can be stored in this format in order to Compress and save space
Later that person realizes that he/she has mistakenly deleted an important photo/image, and wants to restore that image back then Companies Servers can retrieve back
that Image using this process</p>
<br>
<p> It can also be used in Space Research organization, As they don't have to put more focus on Network's strength and throughput between their Research center and
Robot's location (say Robot is on Mars) then Robot can first compress all captured images and compress it in ASCII format using Huffman coding (This takes less 
amount of time then compared to retrieving back the image) and can send that text file to the Space Research Center, And over there Image can be retrieved beck from
ASCII format.</p>
